## Introduction

**LiuAlgoTrader** is a Pythonic all-batteries-included framework
for effective algorithmic trading. The framework is
intended to simplify development, testing,
deployment and evaluating algo trading strategies.

LiuAlgoTrader can run on a Macbook laptop and 
*hedge-on-the-go*, or run on a multi-core hosted Linux server 
and it will optimize for best performance for either. 

LiuAlgoTrader is Work-In-Progress, however it is a fully
functional and powerful framework that may be used almost out-of-the-box.
Assistance in development is highly appreciated,
as well as comments and suggestions. Please check the
